# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Intrinsic-Valuation
This is a data mining project carried out using Rapid Miner tool.This project is part of my ongoing research study in Data Mining. A data mining model in Rapid Miner tool was created, and Yahoo API as a data source was used. We trained on past stock market data with Stock Price as target and different Intrinsic Values which influence that stock price. Our model used two predictive algorithms and gave results of top 50 performing stocks, which should be purchased. We have build a data mining model which uses the absolute stock valuation method(Intrinsic Stock Valuation) for determining if the stocks are undervalued or overvalued.
